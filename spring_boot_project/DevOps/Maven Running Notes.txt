==================
Java Introduction
==================

=> Java is a computer programming language

=> Developed by Sun Microsystem in 1991

=> Using Java we can develop software projects

1) Stand-alone applications
2) Web applications

=> The application which is accessible only in one computer is called as stand-alone application.

	Ex: Calculator, Notepad++, Sublime text, VS Code IDE etc..

=> The application which can be accessed by multiple users at a time is called as web application.

	Ex: Gmail, youtube, facebook, naukri, linkedin etc...


============================
Java Project Execution Flow
============================

1) Developers will write source code (.java files)

2) Compile source code (java compiler) => It generates byte code (.class)

3) Package byte code into jar / war file for execution

=> Stand-alone app will be packaged as jar file (Java Archieve)

=> Web app will be packaged as war file (Web Archieve)

4) If project is packaged as jar then we can execute jar file directley

5) If project is packaged as war then we need to deploy war file in server (Ex: tomcat)


=============================
Java Project Build Process
=============================

1) Download Required Dependencies

2) Add dependencies to build path

3) Compile source code (.java -> .class)

4) Execute Unit Test cases

5) Package Project as Jar or War


=> Earlier developers used to perform above build process manually.

=> To avoid manual build process, build tools came into picture

=> Using Build Tools we can automate project build process.


############# Maven is a build tool for java applications ###########

=================
What is Maven ?
=================

=> Maven software developed by apache org

=> Maven is free & open source software

=> Maven s/w developed using Java Language

=> Maven is called as Build Tool for Java projects

=> Using Maven we can automate Java projects build process


====================
What Maven can do ?
====================

=> Create Project structure

=> Download required libraries

=> Add libraries to build path

=> Compile project source code

=> Execute Unit Test cases (Junits)

=> Package project as jar / war file


===============================
Maven Setup in Windows Machine
===============================

1) Download and Install Java

2) Set JAVA_HOME and Java Path

3) Verify Java Installation

4) Download Maven Software

5) Set MAVEN_HOME and Maven Path

6) Verify Maven Setup


===================
Maven Terminology
==================

=> ArcheType
=> Group ID
=> Artifact ID
=> Version
=> Packaging Type
=> Maven Dependencies
=> Maven Goals
=> Maven Repositories


=> ArcheType represents type of the project

		quickstart => standalone application
		web-app => web application


=> Group ID represents company name

	Ex: com.tcs, com.ibm, in.ashokit etc...


=> Artifact ID represents Project name

	Ex:  sbi-app,  flipkart-app, insta-app


=> Version represents project version number

	Ex: 0.0.1-SNAPHOST, 1.0-RELEASE


=> Packaging type represents packaging format

	Ex: jar , war


=> Maven Dependencies are nothing but libraries required for project development

	Ex: Junit, Spring-core, Hibernate etc....


	Note: We can get maven dependencies from www.mvnrepository.com	


=> Maven Goals are used to perform project build process

	Ex: clean, compile, test, package etc...


=> Maven Repositories are used to store maven dependencies/libraries

	Ex: central repo, remote repo, local repo....		


=========================================
Creating Maven Stand-alone application
=========================================

=> Open command prompt and execute below command to create maven project

$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=in.ashokit -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false

=> Inside the project we can see 'src' folder and pom.xml file

	src : It is used to store project source code (.java files)

	pom.xml : Project Object Model (Maven configuration file)


=> From cmd, Go inside project directory and execute maven goals

		$ cd <project-directory>

		$ mvn clean package


=> Once build got success we can see 'target' directory inside project directory. It contains byte code and our project packaged file (jar)


====================
Maven Dependencies
====================

=> Maven dependencies means libraries required for the project

	Ex: spring-core, junit, hibernate etc..

=> We can find maven dependencies in www.mvnrepository.com

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
		<version>6.0.11</version>
	</dependency>

=> Add above dependency in project pom.xml file under <dependencies/> section and execute maven goals.

	$ mvn clean package


=============
Maven Goals
=============

=> Maven Goals are used to perform Project Build Process

=> We have several maven goals like below


	clean : To delete target folder

	compile : Compile project source code ( convert .java files to .class files)

	test : To execute project unit test cases (Junits)

			test = compile + test

	package : To package our project as jar or war file

			package = compile + test + package

	install : To publish our project into maven repository

			install = compile + test + package + install

=========================================
Creating Maven Web application
=========================================

=> Open command prompt and execute below command to create maven web project

$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=in.ashokit -DartifactId=my-web-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false


=> From cmd, Go inside project directory and execute maven goals

		$ cd <project-directory>

		$ mvn clean package


=> Once build got success we can see 'target' directory inside project directory. It contains byte code and our project packaged file (war).


===================
Maven Repositories
===================

Repositoriy : It is a place where maven dependencies will be stored

=> We have 3 types of repositories in maven

1) Local Repository

2) Cental Repository

3) Remote Repository


=> Local Repository will be created in our machine (.m2 folder)

=> Central Repository will be maintained by apache organization

=> Remote Repository will be maintained by our company to store shared libraries.


Note: Only First time maven will download dependencies from central / remote repository to local repository.

=> Maven project will take dependencies from local repository.


============================
Working with maven in linux
============================

=> Launch Linux VM in AWS cloud (Amazon Linux)

=> Connect with Linux VM using MobaXterm

=> Check Maven version

	$ mvn -v

=> Install maven using below command

	$ sudo yum install maven

=> Check Java & Maven versions

	$ java -version
	$ mvn -vs
