=========
Git Hub
=========

-> Git Hub is a platform which is used to store project related files/code

-> In git hub we can create source code repository

-> source code repository is used to store project source code

Note: For every project one repository will be available

-> All the developers can connect to project repository to store all the source code (Code Integration will become easy)

-> Git Hub repository will monitor all code changes

		 - who modified
		 - when modified
	         - what modified
		 - why modified


===================
Environment Setup
===================

1) Create account in www.github.com

2) Install git client software

3) Open Git bash and configure your name and email

	$ git config --global user.name "your-name"

	$ git config --global user.email "your-email"


Note: Configuring name and email is just one time process.


===============================
What is Git Hub Repository ?
===============================

=> Repository is a place where we can store project source code / files

=> For every project one repository will be created

=> Every repository will have an URL like below

	### Git Repo URL : https://github.com/ashokitschool/devops_14_app.git

=> Project team members will connect with git repository using its URL.

=> We can create 2 types of repositories

	1) Public Repo (anybody can see & you choose who can commit)

	2) Private Repo (you choose who can see & commit)


====================
Git Bash Commands
====================

git config : To configure name & email

git init : To initialize working tree

git add : To add files to staging area

git status : To check working tree status

git commit : To commit files from staging to local repo

git remote add : To add remote repo to working tree

git push : To send files from local repo to remote repo

git restore : To unstage the files & to discard changes made in files

git log : To see commit history

git rm : To remove files from local & remote

git clone : To clone remote repo to local machine

git pull : To take latest changes from remote repo to local repo


===============
Git Branches
===============

=> Branches are used to maintain multiple code bases in the single repository

=> In general people will create below branches in git repository

1) main (default)
2) develop
3) feature
4) qa
5) uat
6) release

Note: We can create any no.of branches in single repository.

=> If we have branches in git repo then multiple teams can work paralelly without effecting other teams code.

Note: When we execute 'git clone' command then we will get code from default branch which is 'main'.

=> In git bash we can switch from one branch to another branch is 'git checkout' command

===========================
What is Branch Merging ?
===========================

=> Merging changes from one branch to another branch is called as Branch merging.

=> We will use 'Pull Request' to perform branch merging.

====================
Git Branches Task
====================

1) Create branches in git hub repository

2) Clone git hub repo

3) Switch from main branch to develop branch using 'git checkout'

4) Create file + Add to staging + commit + push that file 

5) Create pull request to merge develop branch changes to main branch

==========================
What is .gitignore file ?
==========================

=> .gitignore is used to exclude files & folders from our commits

Ex: In maven project,  we should n't commit target folder to git repository hence we can give this info to git using .gitignore file.

========================
What is git Conflict ?
========================

=> When two people making changes in same file and same line then we will get conflicts problem.

=> When conflict occurs we have to resolve them.

=> Conflict can occur in two scenarios

	1) When we execute git pull command 
	2) When we are merging branches


============================================
1) How to remove git local commits ?

	$ git reset HEAD~1

2) How to revert git commits from remote repo?

	$ git revert <commit-id>

Note: After executing git revert we have to execute git push also

3) what is git stash ?

=> It is used to save working tree changes to temporary area and make working tree clean.

		$ git stash

=> We can get stashed changes back using 'git stash apply'

4) Git merge vs Git rebase ?

=> merge & rebase commands are used for branch merging from CLI

merge : It preserve commit history

rebase : It won't preseve commit history


5) What is tag in git ?

=> tags are used to make stage level commits

# Creating tag
$ git tag <tag-name>

# Display all tags
$ git tag

# Push tags to remote repo
$ git push origin --tags


================================

1) git config
2) git init
3) git status
4) git add
5) git commit
6) git push
7) git log
8) git rm
9) git clone
10) git branch
11) git checkout
12) git pull
13) git restore
14) git reset
15) git revert
16) git merge
17) git stash
18) git stash apply

==========================

1) What is Git Hub
2) Git Hub Account Creation
3) Git Client installation 
4) Git Repo creation
5) Git Architecture
6) Git Bash Commands
7) Pushing Maven project to git repo
8) Git Branches
9) Branch Merging
10) Pull Request
11) .gitignore file
12) Git Conflicts
13) Working with Bitbucket
14) Working with tags

===================================


🔥 *Git Hub Lab Task* 🔥

1) Create Maven Web Application
2) Package maven project as war file
3) Create repository in github / bitbucket (public repo)
4) Push maven project into repo using gitbash
   (target folder shouldn't be commited, add this in .gitignore file)
5) Make changes in pom.xml and push changes to repo using git bash
6) Make code changes in index.jsp file and push to central repo
7) Create 'feature' branch in git repo from main branch
8) Switch to feature branch from git bash
9) Make changes in 'feature' branch pom.xml file 
10) Push changes to feature branch
11) Create pull request and merge 'feature' branch changes to 'main' branch


===========================
Realtime Work Process
===========================

1) Developers will send request for DevOps team to create git repository for the project with manager approval.

2) DevOps team will provide Repo Access for team members (RBAC)

3) DevOps team will create git repo and will share that repo URL with Dev Team.

4) Dev team will push their code into git repo and Dev Team will create required branches also

Note: DevOps team will decide Branching strategy for the project.

5) DevOps team will clone git repo for build and deployment process
