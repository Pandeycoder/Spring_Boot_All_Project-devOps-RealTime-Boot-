=====================
Cloud Service Models
=====================

a) IAAS (Infrastructure as a service)

b) PAAS (Platform as a service)

c) SAAS (Software as a service)

=============
What is AWS 
============

-> Since 2006 aws providing IT resources over internet

-> Pay as you go model

-> 190+ contries using

-> Having Global infrastructure


=================
Regions & AZ's
=================

Region -> Geographical location (32 regions)

Availability Zone -> Data Center (server room) -> 102 Az's

==================
AWS Account Setup
==================

-> We can create free account in aws cloud (free tier)

-> 1 year free access (limited services access)

-> Credit Card required (2 rs for account verification)

Note: No Auto Debits

======================
AWS Services Overview
======================

-> AWS providing 200+ services

1) IAM : Identity & Access management (RBAC)

2) EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud (Virtual Machines)

3) S3 : Simple Storage Service (Unlimited Storage)

4) RDS : Relational Database Service (Ex: Oracle, MySQL)

5) Route 53 : Domain Name System (DNS) (ex: www.ashokit.in)

6) Elastic Bean stack : PaaS (To run web applications)

7) VPC : Virtual Private Cloud (isolated network for the resources)

8) Cloud Watch : Monitoring resources in AWS

9) SNS : Simple Notification Service

10) CloudFormation : Infrastructure as a code

11) EFS : Elastic File System (share files with multiple EC2 instances)

12) ECS : Elastic Container Service (to run docker containers)

13) ECR : Elastic Container Registry (to store our images)

14) EKS : Elastic K8S Service (K8s control plane)

15) Cloud Front : To configure Edge locations

16) AWS Lambdas : To implement serverless computing

17) AWS CLI : Command line interface

18) Dynamo DB : No-SQL database



==========================================
How to create infrastrucutre in aws cloud
==========================================

1) Web console (gui)

2) AWS CLI

3) Cloud Formation (YML / JSON)

4) Terraform (supports multiple clouds)


=================================
AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
=================================

-> S3 is a storage service in AWS cloud

-> S3 supports unlimited storage

-> Using S3 we can store any amount of data from anywhere

-> S3 supports object based storage (files)

-> We can upload & download objects (files) at any point of time using S3

-> In S3, we need to create buckets to store data

Note: Every bucket should have unique name

-> When we create a bucket end-point url will be generated to access bucket.

-> When we upload object into bucket, every object will get its own end-point url.

Note: By default, buckets and objects are private (we can them as public).

-> We can create multiple buckets in s3.

=================================
Static Website Hosting using S3
=================================

## Git Hub Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/s3_static_website_hosting.git

Step-1) Create s3 bucket with unique name

Step-2) Upload website files & folders into bucket with public read-access

Step-3) Enable Static website hosting (in bucket properties)

			index-document : index.html
			error-document : error.html

Note: After enabling static website hosting it generates end-point URL for our website

Step-4) Access our website using website endpoint url.
