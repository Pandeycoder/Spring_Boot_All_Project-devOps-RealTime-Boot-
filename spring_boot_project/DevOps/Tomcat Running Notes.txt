===========
WebServers
===========

=> Server is a software which is used to run Web Applications

=> Server is responsible to handle user requests & responses

=> Users can access our web application by sending request to server

=> We have several servers in the market to run our web applications

			a) Tomcat
			b) JBoss
			c) Glasfish
			d) Weblogic
			e) WebSphere

==============
Tomcat Server
=============

=> Tomcat is a web server developed by Apache Organization

=> Tomcat server developed using Java language

Note: To run tomcat server, java should be installed.

=> Tomcat server is used to run Java Web Applications

=> Tomcat is free and open source software

=> Tomcat supports multiple operating systems

=> Tomcat server runs on 8080 port number (we can change it)


================================
Tomcat Server folder structure
================================

bin: It contains files to start & stop server  (windows : bat , Linux : sh)

		 windows: startup.bat & shutdown.bat
		 Linux : statup.sh & shutdown.sh

conf : It contains configuration files

		Ex: server.xml , tomcat-users.xml

webapps : It is called as deployment folder. We will keep war files here.

lib : It contains libraries required for server (jars)

logs : Server log messages will be stored here

temp : Temporary files will be created here (We can delete them)



=============
Tomcat Setup
=============

=> Create Linux VM using Amazon Linux AMI in AWS Cloud

=> Connect to Linux VM using mobaxterm

=> Install Java software

	$ sudo yum install java

=> We can download tomcat software from its offical website

	URL : https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi

=> Download tomcat server tar file

	$ wget <url>

=> Extract tar file

	$ tar -xvf <tar-file-name>

=> Go inside tomcat server bin directory and execute below command

	$ sh startup.sh

=> Upload project war file in webapps folder

=> Enable tomcat server port in security group inbound rules (8080)

=> Access our web application in browser

	URL : http://ec2-public-ip:8080/war-file-name


==================================
*Lab Task To Peform On Linux VM*
==================================

1) Clone Git Repository which contains Maven Web Application

2) Perform Maven Build 

3) Copy war file into tomcat server webapps folder from target

4) Access application url in windows machine browser





============================
Tomcat Admin Console Access
==============================

=> By default the Host Manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as Tomcat. If you wish to modify this restriction, you'll need to edit the Host Manager's context.xml file.

=> File Location : <tomcat-folder>/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

=> In Manager context.xml file, change <Valve> section like below (allow attribute value changed)

<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
     <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow=".*" />
</Context>


============================================================================
Add tomact users in "<tomact-folder>/conf/tomact-users.xml" file like below 
============================================================================

<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<role rolename="manager-script" />
<role rolename="admin-gui" />

<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui" />
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>

-> Stop the tomact server and start it


================================================================================
We can change tomcat server default port in tomact/conf/server.xml file 
================================================================================

-> When we change tomact port number in server.xml file then we have to enable that port in Security Group which is associated with our EC2 instance.
