Project can be developed in 2 ways


1) Monolithic Architecture

2) Microservices Architecture

-------------------------
Monolithic Architecture
-------------------------

-> Monolithic Architecture means everything will be developed in single application

1) Burden will be increased on server

2) Single Point of failure

3) Re-Deploy entire application

Note: It is outdated approach in the industry

----------------------------
Microservices Architecture
----------------------------

-> Microservices architecture nothing but collection of services which are independentley deployable, executable and deliverable.

Ex: makemytrip application

hotels-booking
trains-booking
flights-booking
cabs-booking

-> Every functionality will be developed as seperate service.


1) Loosely coupling

2) No Need to re-deploy entire application

3) There is no single point of failure

4) Maintenence easy

------------------------
Microservices Project
------------------------

Backend app : Springboot app

Git Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/contact_backend_app.git

Frontend app : Angular App

Git Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/contact_ui_ng_app.git

-----------
Procedure
----------

1) Create CI job for backend app

2) Create CD job for backend app

Note: Backend CI job should trigger backend CD job

3) Run Backend CI job and test backend app functionality

4) Configure backend app url in frontend app  (src/app/contact.service.ts)

5) Create CI job for frontend app

6) Create CD job for for frontend app

Note: Frontend CI job should trigger frontend CD job

7) Trigger frontend CI job and test frontend app functionality

Note: Frontend app should communicate backend app
