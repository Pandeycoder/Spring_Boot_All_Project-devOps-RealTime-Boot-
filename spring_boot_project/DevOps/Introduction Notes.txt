=================
Software Project
=================

=> Collection of programs is called as Software Project

================================
Why we need Software Project ?
================================

=> To reduce human efforts

Ex: Net Banking, Ticket Booking, Online Training platforms etc....

======================
Project Architecture
======================

=> Software Project Contains 3 Layers

1) Frontend : User interface (Presentation layer)

2) Backend : Business Layer (Business logic)

3) Database : To store data

======================
Frontend Technologies
======================

	1) HTML & CSS
	2) Java Script
	3) BootStrap
	4) Angular / React JS

=====================
Backend Technologies
=====================

	1) Java
	2) .Net
	3) Python
	4) PHP
	5) Node JS

===========
Databases
===========

	1) Oracle
	2) MySQL
	3) PostGres
	4) SQL Server
	5) Mongo DB
	6) Casandra etc....


===================
What is DevOps ?
==================

	DevOps = Development + Operations

=> DevOps is a culture

=> DevOps is a process

=> DevOps is set of practices

=> DevOps process is used to establish colloboration between Development team & Operations team.

=> The main aim of DevOps is to deliver projects to clients with high quality in less time.

==========================
What is DevOps Life Cycle
=========================

=> We have 7 C's in DevOps life cycle

1) Continuous Planning

2) Continuous Development

3) Continuous Integration

4) Continuous Testing

5) Continuous Deployment

6) Continuous Monitoring

7) Continuous Feedback

=============================================
Roles & Responsibilities of DevOps Engineer
=============================================

1) Setup Infrastructure (Ex: machines, servers, storage, security & network) :: Terraform

2) Configuration Management :: Ansible

3) Setup Source Code Repositories to integrate developers code :: Git Hub / BitBucket 

4) Setup Aritifact Repositories to store build artifacts (jar/war) : Nexus / JFrog

5) Manage Role Based Access (RBAC)

6) Create CI CD Pipelines :: Jenkins

7) Perform Build & Deployment :: Maven, Docker and Kubernetes

8) Generate Code Review Report :: SonarQube

9) Monitor CI CD pipelines 

10) Monitor Infrastructure : Prometheus and Grafana

11) Centralize application Logs :: EFK Stack

12) Issues fixing



================
What is SDLC ?
================

=> SDLC stands for Software Development LifeCycle

=> SDLC represents Software Project Development process from starting to ending

=> We have several stages in SDLC process

1) Requirements Gathering

2) Analyze Requirements

3) Planning

4) Implementation (Development)

5) Testing

6) Deployment

7) Monitoring


=> We have several SDLC methodologies

1) Waterfall Model

2) Agile Model


===============
Waterfall Model
===============

=> It is a linear process to develop and deliver the application

=> All stages will happen one after other

=> Requirements are fixed

=> Budget is fixed

=> Client involvment is very less

=> Client will see the project only at the end

Note: If client don't like our delivery then total money wasted and time wasted.

=============
Agile Model
=============

=> Agile is an iterative approach to develop and deliver the application

=> Planning + Development + Testing + Deployment + Feedback is continuous process in Agile.

=> We will deliver project to client in Multiple Releases (Sprints)

=> Client involement is very high in project

=> Client feedback is very important to proceed further

=> Requirements are not fixed

=> Budget is not fixed

####  Ex: Client provided 100 requirements for development ####

Sprint - 1 :: 30 requirements : plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback

Sprint - 2 :: 30 requirements : plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback

Sprint - 3 :: 30 requirements : plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback

Sprint - 4 :: 10 requirements : plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback


==========================
What is Infrastructure ?
==========================

The resources that are required to run our business is called as Infrastructure

Ex: Machines, Servers, Databases, Power, Network, Storage, Security & Monitoring

=> Challenges with IT infrastructure

	1) Security

	2) Scalability

	3) Availability

	4) Network Issues

	5) Diaster Recovery


=> Purchasing Infrastructure is costly

=> Managing Infrastructure is risky

=> To overcome the above problems of Infrastructure management, now a days companies are preffering Cloud Computing.


========================
What is Cloud Computing 
=========================

=> It is the process of delivering IT resources on demand basis over the internet with Pay as you go model.

=> Pay as you go model means use the resources and pay bill for using them just like our post paid bill / electricity bill/ credit bills etc...

=================
Cloud Providers
================

=> Companies which are providing IT resources over internet are called as Cloud Providers

	1) Amazon => AWS Cloud

	2) Microsoft => Azure Cloud

	3) Google => GCP Cloud

	4) IBM => IBM Cloud

	5) Oracle => Oracle cloud

============================
Cloud Computing Advantages
===========================

1) Pay as you go

2) Low cost

3) Scalability

4) Availability

5) Reliability

6) Unlimited Storage

7) Security

8) Backup


=======================
What is AWS Cloud ?
=======================

=> AWS stands for "Amazon Web Services"

=> AWS started in the year of 2006

=> 190+ countries are using AWS cloud infrastructure to run their businesses.

==========================
AWS Global Infrastructure
==========================

=> AWS maintaining their infrastructure using Regions & Availability Zones

	31 - Regions (Geographical Location)

	99 - Az's (Data Centers)

=> Datacenter means Server Room
