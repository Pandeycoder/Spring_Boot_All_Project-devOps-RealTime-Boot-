===============================
What is Monolith Architecture
==============================

-> Developing all functionalities in single application is called Monolithic Architecture.

			- products
			- cart
			- checkout
			- payment
			- orders
			- tracking
			- cancellation
			- reports
			- admin

-> We will package our application as jar/war => fat jar or fat war

-----------
Advantages
-----------

-> Simple to develop

-> Everything is available at once place

-> Configurations required only once

---------------
Dis-Advantages
---------------

-> Difficult to maintain

-> Single Point of failure

-> Re-Deploy entire application

####### To overcome the problems of monolithic architecture, Microservices architecture came into picture... #######

-> Microservices is not a programmaing language

-> Microservices is not a framework

-> Microservices is not an API

-> Microservices is an Architectural Design Pattern

-> Microservices architecture is used to develop application functionalities with loosely coupling.

-> Instead of developing all functionalities in single project, we will divide functionalities and we will develop multiple apis.

	Note: Every API is called as REST API / Backend API / Service/ Microservice.

-> Microservices are independently deployable components.

Note: Microservices architecture is universal. Any programming language project also can be developed using this architecture.


-----------
Advantages
-----------

1) Loosely coupling

2) Easy To Maintain

3) Faster Development

4) Quick Release

5) Technology independence

6) Less Downtime

-------------------------------
Challenges with Microservices
-------------------------------

1) Bounded Context (deciding no.of services we need to develop in the application)

2) Lot of configurations 

3) Visibility

4) Infrastructure cost


============================
Microservices Architecture
===========================

-> There is no standard / fixed architecture for microservices development.

-> People are customizing microservices architecture based on their requirement.

-> Below are the Microservices architecture components

		1) Service Registry / Service Discovery

		2) Admin Server

		3) Zipkin Server

		4) Backend apis / rest api / services

		5) FeignClient

		6) API Gateway



==================
Service Registry
=================

-> Service Registry is used to maintain list of services available in the project.

-> It provides information about registered services like

		Name of service, url of service, status of service

-> It provides no.of instances available for each service.

-> We can use Eureka Server as a service registry

-> Eureka server provided by Spring Cloud Netflix library

==============
Admin Server
==============

-> Actuators  are used to monitor and manage our applications

-> Monitoring and managing all the apis seperatley is a challenging task

-> Admin Server Provides an user interface to monitor and manage all the apis at one place using actuator endpoints.

==============
Zipkin Server
=============

-> It is Used for Distributed tracing

-> Using zipkin server, we can monitor which api is taking more time to process request.

-> Using Zipkin we can understand how many apis involved in request processing.

=============
Backend apis
=============

-> Backend apis contains business logic

-> Backend apis are also called as REST APIs / services / microservices

	Ex: payment-api, cart-api, flights-api, hotels-api

Note: Backend api can register as client for Service Registry, Admin server & Zipkin server (It is optional)

=============
FeignClient
============

-> It is provided by spring cloud libraries

-> It is used for Inter Service Communication

-> Inter service communication means one api is accessing another api using Service Registry. 

Note: External communication means accessing third party apis.

-> When we are using FeignClient we no need mention URL of the api to access. Using service name feign client will get service URL from service registry.

-> Feign Client uses Ribbon to perform Client side load balancing.

============
API Gateway
============

-> API Gateway is used to manage our project backend apis

-> API Gateway acts as mediator between user requests and backend apis

-> API Gateway acts as entrypoint for all backend apis

-> In API Gateway we will have 2 types of logics

		1) Request Filter : To validate the request (go / no-go)

		2) Request Router : forward request to particular backend-api based on URL Pattern

				/hotels => hotels - api

				/flights => flights - api

				/trains => trains - api

==============
Config Server
==============

-> Config Server is part of Spring Cloud Library

-> Config Server is used to externalize config properties of application

Note: In realtime we will keep app config properties outside of the project to simpliy application maintanence.

=============
Apache Kafka
=============

-> Kafka is a message broker

-> Kafka works based on Publisher - Subscriber model

-> To send msgs from one app to another app we will use Kafka as a mediator.

-> Using Kafka we can develop Event Driven Microservices based applications.

============
Redis Cache
============

-> In our application we will have 2 types of tables


	1) Transaction tables (app will insert/update/delete records)

	2) Non-Transactional tables (app will only retrieve records)


Note: It is not recommended to load non-transactional tables data from db everytime.

-> To reduce no.of round trips between Java app and Database we will use cache.


-> Redis is used for distributed cache implementation.



===============================================================
Steps to develop Service Registry Application (Eureka Server)
===============================================================

1) Create Service Registry application with below dependency

	 - EurekaServer (spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server)

2) Configure @EnableEurekaServer annotation in boot start class

3) Configure below properties in application.yml file

server:
  port: 8761
  
eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false

Note: If Service-Registry project port is 8761 then clients can discover service-registry and will register automatically with service-registry. If service-registry project running on any other port number then we have to register clients with service-registry manually.

4) Once application started we can access Eureka Dashboard using below URL

		URL : http://localhost:8761/



======================================
Steps to develop Spring Admin-Server
======================================

1) Create Boot application with admin-server dependency 
	(select it while creating the project)

2) Configure @EnableAdminServer annotation at start class

3) Change Port Number (Optional)

4) Run the boot application

5) Access application URL in browser (We can see Admin Server UI)

======================================
Steps to work with Zipkin Server
======================================

1) Download Zipin Jar file 

		URL : https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html

2) Run zipkin jar file 

		$ java -jar <jar-name>

3) Zipkin Server Runs on Port Number 9411

4) Access zipkin server dashboard

		URL : http://localhost:9411/

#########################################
Working with Spring Cloud API Gateway
########################################

1) Create Spring boot application with below dependencies

		-> web-stater
		-> eureka-client
		-> cloud-gateway
		-> devtools

2) Configure @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation at boot start class

3) Configure API Gateway Routings in application.yml file like below

-----------------------------application.yml file---------------------------------
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery.locator:
        enabled: true
        lowerCaseServiceId: true
      routes:
      - id: welcome-api
        uri: lb://WELCOME-API
        predicates:
        - Path=/welcome
      - id: greet-api
        uri: lb://GREET-API
        predicates:
        - Path=/greet
  application:
    name: CLOUD-API-GATEWAY
server:
  port: 3333
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In API gateway we will have 3 types of logics

1) Route

2) Predicate

3) Filters

-> Routing is used to defined which request should be processed by which REST API in backend. Routes will be configured using Predicate

-> Predicate : This is a Java 8 Function Predicate. The input type is a Spring Framework ServerWebExchange. This lets you match on anything from the HTTP request, such as headers or parameters.

-> Filters are used to manipulate incoming request and outgoing response of our application

Note: Using Filters we can implement security also for our application.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Component
public class MyPreFilter implements GlobalFilter {

	private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyPreFilter.class);

	@Override
	public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {

		logger.info("MyPreFilter :: filter () method executed...");

		// Accessing HTTP Request information
		ServerHttpRequest request = exchange.getRequest();

		HttpHeaders headers = request.getHeaders();
		Set<String> keySet = headers.keySet();
		
		keySet.forEach(key -> {
			List<String> values = headers.get(key);
			System.out.println(key +" :: "+values);
		});

		return chain.filter(exchange);
	}
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> We can validate client given token in the request using Filter for security purpose

-> We can write request and response tracking logic in Filter

-> Filters are used to manipulate request & response of our application

-> Any cross-cutting logics like security, logging, moniroing can be implemented using Filters




================================
What is Cloud Config Server
================================

=> We are configuring our application config properties in application.properties or application.yml file

		Ex:   DB Props, SMTP props, Kafka Props, App Messages etc...

=> application.properties or application.yml file will be packaged along with our application (it will be part of our app jar file)

=> If we want to make any changes to properties then we have to re-package our application and we have to re-deploy our application.

Note: If any changes required in config properties then We have to repeat the complete project build & deployment which is time consuming process.

=> To avoid this problem, we have to seperate our project code and project confg properties files.

=> To externalize config properties from the application we can use Cloud Config Server.

=> Cloud Config Server is part of Spring Cloud Library.

Note: Application config properties files we will maintain in git hub repo and config server will load them and will give to our application based on our application-name.

=> Our microservices will get config properties from Config server and config server will load them from git hub repo.

================================
Developing Config Server App
================================

1) Create Git Repository and keep ymls files required for projects

			Note: We should keep file name as application name

			app name : greet  then file name : greet.yml

			app name : welcome then file name : welcome.yml


### Git Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/configuration_properties


2) Create Spring Starter application with below dependency

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
	</dependency>

3) Write @EnableConfigServer annotation at boot start class


@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

}

4) Configure below properties in application.yml file

spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ashokitschool/configuration_properties
          clone-on-start: true
management:
  security:
    enabled: false

5) Run Config Server application

=================================
Config Server Client Development
=================================

				a) web-starter
				b) config-client
				c) dev-tools

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
</dependency>


2) Create Rest Controller with Required methods

@RestController
@RefreshScope
public class WelcomeRestController {

	@Value("${msg}")
	private String msg;

	@GetMapping("/")
	public String getWelcomeMsg() {
		return msg;
	}
}

3) Configure ConfigServer url in application.yml file like below

server:
  port: 9090
spring:
  config:
    import: optional:configserver:http://localhost:8080
  application:
    name: greet


4) Run the application and test it.

5) Change app-name to 'welcome' and test it.

=============
Redis Cache
=============

=> Cache : It is a memory to store data in key-value format

=> Cache is used to reduce no.of db calls in our application

=> DB call is a costly operation in terms of execution time and no.of DB calls reduces application performance.

=> To reduce DB calls in our application we will use Cache.

=> Cache is used to improve performance of the application.

================
What is Redis ?
================

The open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.


==============

================================
Circuit Breaker Design Pattern
================================


=> Circuit Breaker => It is an electic concept

=> It is used to protect us from high voltage or low voltage power

=> It is used to divert traffic when some problem detected in normal execution flow.

=> We can use Circuit Break concept in our microservices to implement fault tolerence systems / Resillence systems.

Note: When main logic is failing continuosly then we have to execute fallback logic for sometime.

================================
Circuit Breaker Implementation
================================

#### 1) Create Spring Boot project with below dependencies

		a) web-starter
		b) actuator
		c) aop
		d) resillence4J

		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
			<artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot3</artifactId>
			<version>2.0.2</version>
		</dependency>

#### 2) Create Model class to represent Bored API response

	@Data
	public class Activity {

		private String activity;
		private String type;
		private String link;
		private String key;
		private Integer participants;
		private Double price;
		private Double accessibility;

	}

#### 3) Create Rest Controller to consume Bored API

@RestController
public class ActivityRestController {

	private final String BORED_API = "https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity";

	@GetMapping
	@CircuitBreaker(name = "randomActivity", fallbackMethod = "fallbackRandomActivity")
	public String getRandomActivity() {

		RestTemplate rt = new RestTemplate();

		ResponseEntity<Activity> responseEntity = rt.getForEntity(BORED_API, Activity.class);
		Activity activity = responseEntity.getBody();
		System.out.println("Activity Recieved::" + activity.getActivity());
		
		int i = 10/0;
		
		return activity.getActivity();
	}

	public String fallbackRandomActivity(Throwable throwable) {
		return "Watch a video from Ashok IT...!!";
	}

}


#### 4) Configure Circuit Breaker Properties

spring:
  application.name: resilience4j-demo

management:
  endpoints.web.exposure.include:
    - '*'
  endpoint.health.show-details: always
  health.circuitbreakers.enabled: true

resilience4j.circuitbreaker:
  configs:
    default:
      registerHealthIndicator: true
      slidingWindowSize: 10
      minimumNumberOfCalls: 5
      permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState: 3
      automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled: true
      waitDurationInOpenState: 5s
      failureRateThreshold: 50
      eventConsumerBufferSize: 10


#### 5) Test The application and monitor actuator health endpoint
