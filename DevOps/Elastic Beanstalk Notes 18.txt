Elastic Beanstalk
==================

-> End-to-end web application management service in AWS cloud

-> In AWS, Elastic Beanstalk provides Platform As a Service (PaaS) 

-> Easily we can run our web aplications on AWS cloud using Elastic Beanstalk service.

-> We just need to upload our project code to Elastic Beanstalk it will take care of deployment.

-> Elastic Beanstack will take care of softwares and servers which are required to run our application.

-> Elastic Beanstalk will take care of deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancer and auto scaling etc..

-> To deploy one java web application manually we need to perform below operations

1) Create Security Group

2) Create Network

3) Create Virtual Machine (s)

4) Install Java software in Virtual machine 

5) Install Webserver to run java web application

6) Deploy application to server

7) Re-start the server

8) Create LBR

9) Create AutoScaling etc...

-> AWS providing infrastructure, we are creating platform using AWS infrastructure to run our java application (IaaS Model)

=> Instead of we are preparing platform to run our application, we can use Elastic Beanstalk service to run our web applications.

=> Elastic Beanstalk is providing Platform as a service.
