##################
Sonatype Nexus
##################

-> Nexus is an Open Source Software (OSS) & It is free

-> It is an Artifact Repository Server

-> It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts

-> Nexus software developed using Java Language

Note: To install Nexus s/w we need to install java first

-> Currently people are using Nexus 3.x


Java Build Artifacts: jar and war 

Docker : Docker images

Node JS : NPM packages


Q) What is difference between Nexus and GitHub ?

-> Github is a SCM software which is used to store source code of the project

-> Nexus is Artifact Repository which is used to store build artifacts (jar / war)


Q) When we should store project artifact into nexus ?

-> After build and before deployment



##################
Nexus Setup
##################

-> Take t2.medium instance in AWS EC2 service

-> Java s/w is required to install Nexus

-> Connect to t2.medium instance using mobaxterm


##########  Nexus S/w Installation Process in Amazon Linux OS #############

$ sudo su -

$ cd /opt

# install java 1.8v 
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0

Links to download : https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/product-information/download

# latest version
$ wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.40.1-01-unix.tar.gz

$ tar -zxvf nexus-3.40.1-01-unix.tar.gz

$ mv /opt/nexus-3.40.1-01 /opt/nexus


#As a good security practice, Nexus is not advised to run nexus service as a root user, so create a new user called nexus and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows.
 
$ useradd nexus

# Give the sudo access to nexus user

# execute below command to open sudoers file
$ visudo

# Add below line in suderos file (just below root user details we can add it)
nexus ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/nexus and /opt/sonatype-work directories.

$ chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
$ chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work
$ chmod -R 775 /opt/nexus
$ chmod -R 775 /opt/sonatype-work

# Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file and  uncomment run_as_user parameter and set as nexus user.

$ vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
run_as_user="nexus"

# Create nexus as a service

$ ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus

# Switch as a nexus user and start the nexus service as follows.

$ su - nexus

# Enable the nexus services
$ sudo systemctl enable nexus

# Start the nexus service
$ sudo systemctl start nexus

# Access the Nexus server from browser.
 
URL : http://IPAddess:8081/

Note: Enable this 8081 port number in Security Group

# Default Username
User Name: admin

# we can copy nexus password using below command
$ sudo cat /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password

-> We can change nexus default properties 

	/opt/nexus/etc/nexus-default.properties


#################################
Integrate Maven App with Nexus
#################################

-> Create Repositories in Nexus to store build artifacts

-> We will create 2 types of repositories in Nexus

	1) snapshot

	2) release

-> If project is under development then that project build artifacts will be stored into snapshot repository

-> If project development completed and released to production then that project build artifacts will be stored to release repository

-> Create Repositories by selecting "Maven 2 (Hosted)"

Snanpshot Repo URL : http://15.206.128.43:8081/repository/ashokit-snapshot/

Release Repo URL : http://15.206.128.43:8081/repository/ashokit-release/

Note: Based on <version/> name available in project pom.xml file it will decide artifacts should be stored to which repository

-> Nexus Repository details we will configure in project pom.xml  file like below


  <distributionManagement>  

	<repository>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<name>Ashok IT Releases Nexus Repo</name>
		<url>http://15.206.128.43:8081/repository/ashokit-release/</url>
	</repository>
	
	<snapshotRepository>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<name>Ashok IT Snapshots Nexus Repo</name>
		<url>http://15.206.128.43:8081/repository/ashokit-snapshot/</url>
	</snapshotRepository>
	
  </distributionManagement>

-> Nexus Server Credentials will be configured in Maven "settings.xml" file

-> Maven Location : C:\apache-maven-3.8.5\conf

-> In settings.xml file, under <servers> tag add below <server> tag

	<server>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<username>admin</username>
		<password>admin</password>
	</server>


-> Once these details are configured then we can run below maven goal to upload build artifacts to Nexus Server

	$ mvn clean deploy


Note: When we execute maven deploy goal, internally it will execute 'compile + test + package + install + deploy' goals.




##################
Remote Repository 
##################

-> Remote repository used for shared libraries (common jars required for multiple projects)

-> If we want to use few jar files in multiple projects in the company then we will use Remote Repository to store those jars (libraries).

-> Remote repository is specific to our company projects

-> Create remote repo in nexus and upload a jar file 

	-> Go to Repositories
	-> Create New Repository
	-> Choose Maven (Hosted) Repository
	-> Give a name for Repository (Ex: ashokit-remote-repository) & Complete the process
			
Note: With above steps Remote Repository got created.


Remote Repo URL : http://13.126.20.221:8081/repository/ashokit-remote-repository/

	-> Go to BrowseSection
	-> Select Remote Repository (By default it is empty)
	-> Click on Upload Component
	-> Upload Jar file and give groupId, artifactId and Version		

			groupId : in.ashokit
			artifactId : pwd-utils
			version : 1.0		

-> Take dependency details of uploaded jar file and add in project pom.xml as a dependency like below

<dependency>
  <groupId>in.ashokit</groupId>
  <artifactId>pwd-utils</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

-> We need to add Remote Repository Details in pom.xml above <dependencies/> tag

		<repositories>
			<repository>
				<id>nexus</id>
				<url>http://15.206.128.43:8081/repository/ashokit-remote-repo/</url>
			</repository>
		</repositories>

-> After adding the remote repository details in pom.xml then execute maven package goal and see dependency is downloading from nexus repo or not.

		$ mvn clean package
