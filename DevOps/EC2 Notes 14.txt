#########################
EC2 Service
#########################

-> EC2 stands for "Elastic Compute Cloud"

-> EC2 is most demanded service in AWS cloud

-> EC2 is used to create Virtual Machines in AWS cloud

-> EC2 VM is called as EC2 instance

			EC2 Instance = Computer / Server / VM / Virtual machine

-> EC2 instances are re-sizable (we can change configuration)

-> EC2 is a regional service

-> EC2 is a paid service

-> EC2 instances minimum billing period is 1 hour

Note: To encourage learners, AWS provided EC2 instances (t2.micro type) free for 1 year 
	  (Monthly 750 hours)

-> When we create EC2 instance, AWS will provide default storage using EBS.

				EBS Max Size : 16 TB (16000 GB)

				Windows VM : 30 GB (free of cost, default)
				Linux VM : 8 GB (free of cost, default)


-> For EC2 instance, AWS will provide default VPC.

-> To create EC2 instance, we need to choose AMI (Amazon machine image)

-> Key-Pair is used to secure EC2 instance.

-> Key Pair contains public key and private key

Note: One Key-Pair we can use for Multiple EC2 instances irrespective of OS

-> For EC2 instance we will attach firewall Security rules using Security Group

			
				Windows VM => RDP : 3389

				Linux VM => SSH : 22

				HTTP => HTTP : 80

				HTTPS => HTTPS : 443

Note: One security group we can attach to multiple EC2 instances.

########### Lab Task : Launch Windows VM and Connect to it using RDP Client ############



==========================
Launch Linux VM using EC2
==========================

1) Create Linux VM

2) Connect to Linux VM using MobaXterm


======================
Types of IP's in AWS
======================

1) Public IP ( It is dynamic IP, it is used to connect with EC2 VM from outside)

Note: When we re-start EC2 VM then Public IP gets changed.

2) Private IP ( It is fixed IP, it is used internally in AWS cloud )

Note: When we re-start EC2 VM then Private IP will not change. It is fixed and used for internal purpose.

3) Elastic IP ( It is fixed Public IP, It is chargeble )

Note: When we create and attach Elastic IP to ec2 instance then it will become fixed public ip for that instance. Even if we re-start the machine that IP will remain same.

######################### Lab Task on EC2 IP addresses ###################

1) Create EC2 Instance (Amazon Linux)

2) Observe IPs associated with that Machine
		
			=> Public IP
			=> Private IP

3) Stop the EC2 instance and Observe IPs associated with that Machine

			=> Public IP will be removed
			=> Private IP remains same

4) Create Elastic IP and associate that Elastic IP to ec2 instance

5) Observe IPs associated with that Machine (Elastic IP will become Public IP)

6) Re-Start the EC2 instance and Observe IPs associated with that Machine

			=> Public IP remains same
			=> Private IP remains same

7) De-Associate Elastic IP from EC2 (Action -> Networking -> De-Assocate Elastic IP)

8) Release Elastic IP back to AWS cloud (Elastic IP -> Actions -> Release)

****** Note: Elastic IPs are chargeble, If we are not using then we have to release them to AWS ***********

================================================================================

==========================
EC2 Instances Categories
==========================

1) On-Demand Instances

2) Reserved Instances

3) Spot instances

4) Dedicated Host Instances

=======================
On-Demand Instances
=======================

=> Whenever we want then we can create it

=> Fixed Price (Hourly Based)

=> Pay for use

=> No Prior Payments

=> No Commitment


====================
Reserved Instances
====================

=> It is like advanced booking for Ec2 instances

=> Longterm Commitment

=> Commitement 1 year or 3 years

=> AWS will provide discount when we go for longterm commitment

=> Prior Payment option is available (Partial Payment also available)

===============
Spot Instances
==============

=> It is like bidding or auction

=> AWS will offer High Capacity systems for Low Price


==========================
Dedicated Host Instances
==========================

=> It is physical instance that AWS will provide to customers

=> These are very costly instances


===================
EC2 Instance Types
===================

1) General Purpose Instances

2) Compute Optimized

3) Memory Optimized

4) Storage Optimized

5) Accelarated Computing


========================
What is AMI in AWS ?
==========================

=> AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image

=> AMI contains set of configurations to launch virtual machines

			a) Windows AMIs
			b) Linux AMIs
			c) Mac AMIs

=> AWS provided several Quick Start AMIs to launch Virtual Machines.

=> In AWS, we can create our own AMIs also.

=> By Default our AMI visibility is Private (We can make it as public)


############# AMI Lab Task ##############

1) Create AMI from existing EC2 VM

2) Check AMI display in AMI Dashboard

3) Change AMI visibility to Public (It will be available for all AWS users)  (Optional)

4) Launch New EC2 instance using our AMI

5) Connect to new ec2 vm using MobaXterm



########################
EBS Volumes & Snapshots
########################

=> EBS stands for Elastic Block Store

=> EBS is a block level storage device that can be associated with EC2 instance

=> EBS providing both Primary and Secondary Storage for EC2 instances

=> EBS volumes are divided into 2 categories

			1) Root Volumes
			2) Additional Volumes

=> When we launch EC2 VM then by default EBS Root Volume will be attached to our EC2 instance

				For Windows  by default : 30 GB space in Root Volume

				For Linux  by default : 8 GB space in Root Volume


		########  Note: EBS Volume max size is 16 TB (16000 GB) ######


=> EBS root volume is mandatory to Launch any EC2 instance.

=> If we detach EBS root volume from EC2 instance then we can't start that Instance.


=> We can create Additional EBS volumes and we can attach / detach with EC2 instances.

=> Additional EBS volumes are optional Volumes.


*** One EC2 instance can have multiple EBS volumes

*** One EBS volume can be attached with only one EC2 instance at a time.

*** EBS Volumes are AVailability Zone Specific ***

=================
EBS Volume Types
==================

=> We have 5 types of EBS volumes

1) General Purpose (Min: 1 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB)

2) Provisioned IOPS (Min: 4 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB)

Note: Provisioned IOPS (io2) supports 65 TB

3) Cold HDD (Min: 125 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB)

4) Throughput Optimized  (Min: 125 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB)

5) Magnetic (standard)   ( Min: 1 GiB, Max: 1024 GiB )


###################
Today's Lab Task
###################

1) Create 2 EC2 Linux instances with Amazon Linux 2 AMI 
    (They will have EBS root volumes with 8 GB)

2) Create Additional EBS volume with 12 GB (check AZ for VMs and create EBS Vol in same AZ)

3) Attach EBS Additional volume of 12 GB to EC2 VM-1 for storing data

4) Connect to EC2 VM-1 instance and verify volumes (EBS both volumes shud display)

			$ lsblk
			
			Root Vol : /dev/xvda
			Addn Vol : /dev/xvdf
			
5) Create a directory and mount EBS Additional volume to created directory & create files

			$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

			$ mkdir dir1

			$ sudo mount /dev/xvdf dir1

			$ cd dir1

			$ touch f1.txt f2.txt

6) Detach EBS Additional volume from EC2 VM-1

7) Attach previously created EBS Additional volume to EC2 VM-2

8) Connect to EC2 VM-2 instance and verify volumes (EBS volume shud display)

9) Create a directory and mount EBS Additional volume to created directory

			$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

			$ mkdir dir2

			$ sudo mount /dev/xvdf dir2

			$ ls -l dir2

10) Verify data which stored previously in EBS Addn Vol available or not
 (it should present)

11) Stop Instances and delete volumes





=================
EBS - Snapshots
=================

=> Snapshots are used for Volume Backups

=> Snapshots are Regional Specific (Volumes are AZ specific)

=> From volume we can create snapshot and from snapshot we can create volume

			Volume ====> Snapshot =====> Volume

=> Snapshots can't be attached with EC2 instance (Only Volumes we can attach with EC2)



##########################################
Static WebSite Hosting using EC2 instance
##########################################

=> Website : Collection of web pages

=> We have 2 types of websites

		1) Static Website (Same content for all users)

		2) Dynamic Website (Content based on user)

=> In order to run a  website we need Webserver

=> Webserver is a software which provides runtime environment(platform) to run web applications.


===========================
Install Web Server (Httpd)
===========================

$ sudo yum update -y

$ sudo yum install httpd

$ sudo systemctl start httpd

Note: Enable HTTP in Security Group Inbound rules

=> Access our website using EC2 vm public ip (we should be able to see Test web page)

=> We can change content of our website using below commands

$ cd /var/www/html

$ sudo vi index.html

<h1> Welcome to Ashok IT <h1>

<h2> Contact Us : + 91 - 9985296677 </h2>

=> Access our website using EC2 vm public ip (we should be able to see our content in web page)

=========================
What is User Data in EC2
=========================

=> User Data is used to execute the script when ec2 instance launched for first time

=> We can say user data is default script to execute when EC2 instance is launched.

Note: If we stop and start ec2 machine then User data will not execute.



sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Life Insurance Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

####################################


=> When we run our application in Single Server then we may get below issues

1) Burden on Server

2) Slow Responses

3) Server can crash

4) App downtime

5) Effect on Brand Value

6) Revenue Loss

=> To overcome these issues we will go for Load Balancing.


######################
Load Balancing in EC2
######################

-> Load Balancing is the process of distributing application load to multiple servers

-> Instead of deploying our application in one server, we will deploy in multiple servers

-> All the servers will be connected to Load Balancer

-> LBR will distribute traffic to all connected servers using Round Robin algorithm

==================================
Process to Setup Load Balancer
==================================

1) Create Security Group with below Protocols in Inbound Rules

		SSH - 22
		HTTP - 80

	SGName : ashokit_Security_group


2) Create first EC2 instance (EC2-1) and Host Web Application

Note: Configure below script as 'User Data' at the time of launching the instance

#! /bin/bash

sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Life Insurance Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

3) Create second EC2 instance (EC2-2) and host web application

Note: Configure below script as 'User Data' at the time of launching the instance

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Life Insurance Server - 2</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

4) Create Load Balancer ( ALB ) and attach both EC2 instances as one target group

		Scheme : Internet facing

		Select : New Target Group (Add both EC2 instances)

		Listner : HTTP : 80

		Security Group : ashokit_Security_Group

Note: Once Load Balancer created, DNS will be generated (it will take upto 3 mins)


5) Send a request to Load Balancer DNS URL and see the response 

 (it should distribute traffic to both servers)


Note
++++++++++
1) DELETE Load balancer
2) Delete EC2 instances

###############################
Types of Load Balancers in AWS
###############################


-> We have 4 types of Load balancers in AWS

1) Application Load Balancer

2) Network Load Balancer

3) Gateway Load Balancer

4) Classic Load Balancer (Will be retiering on Aug 15, 2022)


-> When you want to deal with HTTP and HTTPS requests then Application Load Balancer is recommended. Application Load Balancer supports path based routing.

-> When you have static ip address and wants to process millions of requests per second then go for Network Load Balancer (This gives ultra performance)

-> When your application dealing with third party services then go for Gateway Load Balancer


######################
Microservices
#####################

-> In realtime, project will be developed in 2 ways

1) Monolith Architecture based project

2) Microservices Architecture based project


-> Monolith Architecture means all the fuctionalities will be developed in single project
-> If we change some code then it may effect on another fucntionality
-> The maintenence will become very difficult when we follow monolith architecture

-> To overcome the problems of Monolith Architecture, now a days people are using Microservices Architecture in the Realtime.

-> In Microservices architecture, project functionality will be divided into multiple services
-> Every service is a seperate project
-> When we change functionality of one service it will not effect on another service
-> Every service will be running as a seperate project in seperate server
-> Easy to maintain



######################################
Setup LBR with multiple Target Groups
######################################


-> Create Security Group with SSH-22 and HTTP-80 Protocols

1) Create EC2 Instance-1 For Flights (Flights-Server-1) 

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Flights Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

2) Create EC2 Instance-2 for Flights  (Flights-Server-2)

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Flights Server - 2</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start


-> Create "Flights Target Group" with Flights EC2 instances
 
3) Create EC2 instance-1 for Trains (Trains-Server-1)

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Trains Server - 1</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start


4) Create EC2 Instance-2 for Trains (Trains-Server-2)

#! /bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>Trains Server - 2</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start


-> Create "TrainsTargetGroup" for Trains EC2 instances

-> Create Application Load Balancer 

-> Configure Routing in Application Balancer to route the request to "Target Group" based on URL

	(At the time of LBR creation choose existing target group as Flights-TargetGroup)

	#######  AfFter Load Balacner Created We need to configure Routing Rules ########

(Go to LBR -> Listeners -> Click on View/Edit Rules -> Click on + Symbol -> CLick on Insert Rule -> Add the rule)


Note: In this scenario i have added query string rule

	Rule-1 ==>	Key : type, value = flights ==> Forward it to "Flights-TargetGroup"

	Rule-2 ==> Key : type, value = trains ==> Forward it to "Trains-TargetGroup"


Default ALB URL : http://makemytriplbr-1672601111.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com/


=========================
URLS with Query String
========================

URL-1 : http://makemytripalb-1456632845.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com?type=trains

URL-2 : http://makemytripalb-1456632845.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com?type=flights

======
Note
=====

-> After practise Delete Target Groups, LBR and EC2 instances to avoid billing

================
Auto Scaling
=================

=> AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

=> Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. 

=> Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.

=> The process of increasing and decreasing no.of ec2 instances based on the load is called as Auto Scaling.

=============================
Advantages with Auto Scaling
=============================

1) Fault Tolerenece : Detect when an instance is unhealthy, terminate it, and launch an instance to replace it.

2) Availability : Ensure that your application always has the right amount of capacity to handle the current traffic demand.

3) Cost Management : Save money by dynamically launching instances when they are needed and terminate them when they aren't needed.

=================================
How to setup Auto Scaling Group
=================================

1) Create Launch Template

2) Create AutoScaling Group with Launch Template

3) Configure Desired, Min and Max Capacity

4) Attach AutoScaling Group to particular Target Group

5) Configure Scaling Policy
