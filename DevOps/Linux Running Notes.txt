======================================
Module-2 : Linux OS + Shell Scripting
======================================

=> Operating System is a platform which is used to communicate with computers

=> Operating System acts as mediator between users and computers

=> Operating System is mandatory to use a computer

=> There is no use of computer which doesn't have Operating System

=> Using Operating System we can run applications in Computer

	Ex: Notepad, Calc, Paint, Browser, VLC Player

=> There are several Operating Systems available in the market

		1) Windows OS

		2) Linux OS

		3) Mac OS

============
Windows OS
============

-> Developed by Microsoft Company

-> It is GUI Based (Graphical User interface)

-> Easy to use

-> Highly recommended for personal use

   Ex: Watching Movies, Playing Games, Browsing, Storing personal data ....

-> Security features are very less (we need to install Anti Virus softwares)

-> Windows is Licensed Operating System.

-> Windows is single user based OS

==========
Linux OS
==========

-> It is free and open source operating system

-> Multi User Based Operating System (multiple users can access at a time)

-> Anti Virus S/w not required for Linux Machines

-> Highly recommended for Server Environments

	Ex: Database, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, k8s.....

-> Linux is CLI based (Command Line Interface)

=================
History of Linux
=================

-> Developed by Linus Torvalds

-> Earlier "Linus Torvalds" used Unix OS and he faced some challenges with Unix OS and he reported to company to change Unix OS but Company rejected his suggetions.

-> Linus Torvalds started developing his own operating by using "Minux OS"

	(Li) nus + Mi (nux) ===> Linux

-> After developing Linux OS "Linux Torvalds" released Linux OS into market for free of cost along with source code.

-> Several Companies downloaded Linux OS source code and modified according to their requirement and released into market with their own brand names. Those are called as Linux Distributions / Flavours .

			1) Amazon Linux
			2) Ubuntu Linux
			3) CentOS Linux	
			4) Debian Linux
			5) Fedora Linux
			6) SUSE Linux
			7) Kali Linux
			8) RED HAT Linux etc..

==================================
Environment Setup to Learn Linux
=================================

1) Create Account in AWS Cloud & Login into that

2) Create Linux Virtual Machine using EC2 service

3) Connect with Linux VM using MobaXterm software (Windows Users)

4) Practice Linux Commands

===============
Linux Commands
===============

whoami : Displays logged in username

date : displays current date

cal : displays calendar

clear : Clear screen

pwd : Display present working directory

cd : change directory

mkdir : To create directory (folder)

rmdir : To remove empty directory

Note: To remove non-empty directory we will use below command

	rm -r <dirname>

ls : List files & directories available in present working directory

	ls -l  : Long listing of the files & directories in alphabetical order

	ls -lr : Long listing of the files & directories in reverse of alphabetical order

	ls -lt : Display latest files on top
	
	ls -ltr : Display old files on top

	ls -la : To display hidden files

	ls -li : To display files with inode numbers

mv : To rename/move files & directories

touch : To create empty files

rm : Remove file

cat : To create files with data, append data to file and display file content

	cat > f1.txt : Create new file with data

	cat f1.txt : Print file content from top to bottom

	cat -n f1.txt : Print file content with line numbers

	cat >> f1.txt : Append data to existing file


tac : To print file content from bottom to top

	tac f1.txt

cp : Top copy data from one file to another file

	cp f1.txt f2.txt


Note: How to copy more than one file data to another file

	cat m1.txt m2.txt > m3.txt : Copy two files data to 3rd file


wc : word count (it will display no.oflines, no.of words and no.of characters in given file)

	wc m3.txt


head : Display first 10 lines of the file

 	head devops.txt (print first 10 lines)

	head -n 15 devops.txt (print first 15 lines)

	head -n 30 devops.tx (print first 30 lines)
	

tail : Display last 10 lines of the file

	tail devops.txt (print last 10 lines)

	tail -n 15 devops.txt (print last 15 lines)

	tail -n 30 devops.tx (print last 30 lines)

	tail -n +5 devops.txt (print from 5th line to last line)



=======================
Text Editors in Linux
=======================

vi : visual editor

=> Using vi we can edit files in linux

	$ vi linux.txt

Insert mode : To insert/modify data we should go to insert mode (press i)

Esc Mode : After modifications completed we should press Esc key

Save and Close : Press :wq to save the changes and close the file.

Close without Saving : press :q! for closing file without saving the changes

============
SED command
===========

=> SED stands for Stream Editor

=> SED command is used for replacement or substitution 

=> We can replace one word with another word using SED command without opening file
	
	$ sed 's/linux/unix/' linux.txt

Note: by default sed command will give output to terminal but it won't make changes to original file. To make changes to original file we need to use -i in sed command

	$ sed -i 's/linux/unix/' linux.txt


	# delete last line of the file
	$ sed -i '$d' linux.txt	

	# Delete second line of the file
	$ sed -i '2d' linux.txt

	# Delete from second line to till last line
	$ sed -i '2, $d' linux.txt

=============
grep command
=============

=> Grep stands for global regular expression print

=> It is used for file content search based on given pattern


# Pattern Matching print
$ grep "keyword" filename

# Pattern Matching by ignoring case sensitive
$ grep -i 'devops' mydata.txt

# Print matching pattern lines along with line numbers
$ grep -n 'DEVOPS' mydata.txt

# invert match (print lines which doesn't have given pattern)
$ grep -v 'DEVOPS' mydata.txt


================================
Working with Zip files in Linux
================================

Syntax to create To zip file : $ zip <zip-file-name> <files-to-add>

# Create zip file (all .txt files will be added to notes.zip file)
$ zip notes *.txt

# Print content of zip file
$ zip -sf notes.zip

# Add new file to existing zip
$ zip notes f1.txt

# Delete file from zip
$ zip -d notes f1.txt

# Unzip the files from zip file
$ unzip <zip-file-name>

# Create zip file with encryption (set password)
$ zip -e <filename> <files-to-add>


###### Note: man command is used to get documentation about linux commands #####

$ man vi

$ man ls

$ man zip


##########################
02 - Aug - 2023 (Wednesday)
###########################

===========================
locate and find commands
==========================

=> locate and find commands are used for file search

=> locate command will search for the files in locate database.

	$ sudo yum install locate

	$ locate 'apache'


=> find command is used for more advanced search in linux os
	

# search for the file under home directory
$ sudo find /home -name f1.txt

# find empty files under home directory
$ sudo find /home -type f -empty

# find empty directories under home directory
$ sudo find /home -type d -empty


========================
Users & Groups in Linux
========================

=> Linux is Multi User Based OS

=> We can create Multiple User accounts in Linux Machine

=> In Every Linux Machine by default one 'root' user account will be available

		root user => super user / Administrator

Note: Root user will have all priviliges to perform any operation.

=> When we launch EC2 instance using "Amazon Linux AMI" we will get 'ec2-user' by default.

Note: For every user one home directory will be created in Linux machine under 'home' directory

	ec2-user => /home/ec2-user

	ashok => /home/ashok

	raju => /home/raju

	rani => /home/rani


=> To get user account information we can use 'id' command in linux machine

	$ id <uname>

# switch to root user account
$ sudo su -

# logout from root user account
$ exit


====================================
Working with User Accounts in Linux
===================================

# swith to root user 
$ sudo su -

# Create New User Account
$ useradd <uname>

# Set Password for user account
$ passwd <uname>

# Display users we have created
$ cat /etc/passwd

# Delete User (it won't delete user home directory)
$ userdel <uname>

# Delete user along with user home directory
$ userdel <uname> --remove

# switch to user account
$ su <uname>

=====================================
Working with User Groups in Linux
=====================================

# Display all user-groups available in Linux

$ cat /etc/group

Note: When we create user in linux machine, it will create user account + user-group

# Create New User-Group
$ groupadd <group-name>

# Add user to user-group
$ usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name>

# Remove user from user-group
$ gpasswd -d <user-name> <group-name>

# Display users belongs to user-group
$ sudo lid -g <group-name>

# Rename user-group
$ groupmod -g <new-name> <existing-name>

# Rename user
$ usermod -l <new-name> <existing-name>

# Delete User Group
$ groupdel <group-name>

==========================
File Permissions In Linux
==========================

=> In Linux VM everything is treated as file (Ex: normal files, directory files)

=> We can secure our files using File Permissions

=> We have 3 types of file permissions

	1) READ (r)

	2) WRITE (w)

	3) EXECUTE (x)


=> File Permissions are divided into 3 sections

	1) User Permissions (rwx)
	2) OWNER Group Permissions(rwx)
	3) OTHERS Permissions (rwx)

	Ex:  rwxrwxrwx


=> To change file permissions in linux we can use 'chmod' command


Note: "+" is used to add permission and  " - " is used to remove permission


# Adding write permission for user on f1.txt file
$ chmod u+w f1.txt

# Adding execute permission for group
$ chmod g+x f1.txt

# Remove write permission for group
$ chmod g-w f1.txt

# Add write and execute permission for others
$ chmod o+wx f1.txt

# Remove all permissions for others
$ chmod o-rwx f1.txt

===================================
File Permissions in Numeric Format
===================================

0 : No Permission

1 : Execute

2 : Write

3 : Write + Execute => 2 + 1

4 : Read

5 : Read + Execute => 4 + 1

6 : Read + Write => 4 + 2

7 : Read + Write + Execute => 4 + 2 + 1


$ chmod 777 f1.xt
$ chmod 445 f1.txt
$ chmod 655 f1.txt
$ chmod 444 f1.txt

Q-1) What are default file permissions in Linux in numeric format ?

Q-2) What are default directory permissions in Linux in numeric format ?



============================
Working with chown command
===========================

=> chown command is used to change file owner and file group

# making ashok as owner for f1.txt file
$ sudo chown ashok f1.txt

# making dbteam as owner group for f1.txt file
$ sudo chown :dbteam f1.txt

# Changing owner and group at a time
$ sudo chown ashok:ashok f1.txt

Note: We can use userid and group id also in chown command instead of names.

===========================
Hard Links and Soft Links
===========================

=> In Linux we can create Link files (similar to shortcuts in windows)

=> We have 2 types of links in Linux

	1) Hard Link

	2) Soft Link

---------------------------
Syntax To create Hard Link
--------------------------

$ ln <orginal-file> <link-file>

$ touch m1.txt

$ ln m1.txt m10.txt

$ cat > m1.txt

$ cat m10.txt

$ ls -li

Note-1: original file and link file will have same inode number

Note-2: When we write data to original file then it will reflect in link file also.

Note-3: When we delete original file link file is not effected (hard link)

---------------------------
Syntax To create soft Link
---------------------------

$ ln -s <original-file> <link-file>

$ touch f1.txt

$ ln -s f1.txt f10.txt

$ ls -li

$ cat > f1.txt

$ cat > f10.txt

$ rm f1.txt

$ ls -li

Note: When we remove original file then soft link file will become dangling. We can't access it.

=============================
Process Management in Linux
============================

=> Process represents running application

=> In Windows machine we can see running processes using "Task Manager"

=> In Linux machine we can see running process using ps command

$ ps

$ top

=> To kill process in linux machine we will use kill command

	$ kill -9 <process-id>

=====================
Networking Commands
=====================

# To get ip address of machine
$ ifconfig

# To check connectivity
$ ping <ip>
$ ping www.google.com
$ ping www.facebook.com

# To download files using url
$ wget <url>
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.78/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.78.zip

# To send HTTP Request to URL
$ curl <url>


========================
Utility Commands
========================

# Display memory details
$ free

# Install htop command
$ sudo yum insall htop

# memory details with dynamic view
$ htop

# Display OS information
$ cat /etc/os-release

# Display Kernel Version
$ uname -r

# Check all Users Login history In Linux
$ lastlog

# Check Specific User login history
$ last <uname>

# Get last 3 login details
$ last -3


===========================
Package Managers in Linux
===========================

=> Package Managers are used to install softwares in Linux Machines

=> We have several package managers in linux

1) yum (Yellow Dog updater & modified)

	Ex: Amazon Linux, RED HAT Linux, CentOS

2) apt  (Advanced Packaged Tool)

	Ex: Ubuntu

3) dnf  (Dandified YUM package) 
	
	Ex: It is replacing yum in latest versions of centos


# Install Java in Amazon Linux
$ sudo yum install java

# Check Java version
$ java -version

# Install Maven in Amazon Linux
$ sudo yum install maven

# Check Maven version
$ mvn -v

# Install git client in Amazon Linux
$ sudo yum install git

# Check Git version
$ git -v

# check path of packages we installed
$ whereis java
$ whereis mvn
$ whereis git


=========================
What is a Sudoers File?
========================

=> A Sudoers file is just like any other file on a Linux Operating System. 

=> It plays a vital role in managing what a “User” or “Users in a Group” can do on the system.

======================
Why the name Sudoers?
======================

=> The word Sudo is the abbreviation of the term “Super User Do”. 

=> The users with Sudo permission are called as Sudo Users. 

=> Management of all these sudo users is done through a file called as Sudoers File. 

=> This file also lives in the /etc directory just like any other configuration file.

$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers

##### User Privilege Specification #####

root ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL

Note: ‘#’ indicates comment in the file, OS will ignore this line while executing.

Syntax : User <space> OnHost = (Runas-User:Group) <space> Commands

Example: root ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL

Read it as — User Root can Run Any Command as Any User from Any Group on Any Host.


→ The first ALL is used to define HOSTS. We can define Hostname/Ip-Address instead of ALL. ALL means any host.

→ Second ALL : Third ALL is User:Group. Instead of ALL we can define User or User with the group like User:Group. ALL:ALL means All users and All groups.

→ Last ALL is the Command. Instead of ALL, we can define a command or set of commands. ALL means all commands.

#### To put it very simple, it is “who where = (as_whom) what”. ####


=> Tnother example to clearly understand the fields in the syntax:

Example : ashok ALL = (root) /usr/bin/cat /etc/shadow

Read this as — User “ashok” can Run the command “/usr/bin/cat /etc/shadow” as ROOT user on all the HOSTS.


## Edit sudoers file
$ sudo visudo

## close sudeors file
$ ctrl + x

=================================
What is .bashrc file in linux ?
=================================

=> It is used to configure environment variables in Linux Machines

	Ex: Java Path, Maven Path etc....

=> For every user account one .bashrc file will be available under user home directory

=> .bashrc file is hidden file. To see this we need to execute 'ls -la'	


=========================
What is .ssh in linux ?
==========================

=> This is hidden directory which contains authorized_keys (pem file public key)

=> We can get our authorized_key using below command

$ cat .ssh/authorized_keys


1) What is Operating System
2) Windows OS
3) Linux OS
4) Linux Distributions (200+)
5) Linux Virtual Machine Setup in AWS
6) Connect with Linux VM using MobaXterm
7) Connect with Linux VM using Putty
8) Linux commands
9) Working with Directories
10) Working with Files
11) Text Editors (vi & sed)
12) Pattern Matching (grep)
13) head & tail
15) User Management 
16) Group Management
17) File Permissions (chmod)
18) Ownership (chown)
19) find and locate 
20) Working with zip files
21) Network commands
22) Package Managers
23) Sudoers file
24) .bashrc file
25) .ssh Authorized keys


====================
Linux Architecture
====================

1) Applications / Commands

2) Shell : It is mediator between application/users and kernel. It will verify command syntax.

3) Kernel : It is mediator between Shell and Linux Hardware components

4) Hardware

=================
Shell Scripting
=================

=> Scripting means writing set of commands in a file and executing them.

=> Scripting is used to automate our daily routine tasks in the project.

    Ex: delete temp files, take files backup, archive log files, monitor servers etc..

=> Shell script file will have .sh extension

=> We can execute shell script file like below

	$ sh <file-name>

=========
Script-1
========

whoami
pwd
date
ls -l
touch f2.txt
ls -l

=========
Script-2
========

echo "Welcome to Ashok IT";

echo "DevOps Course is Running"

=========
Script-3
========

echo "Enter Your Name";

read name

echo "Good Evening $name"

=========
Script-4
========

echo "Enter first number"

read a

echo "Enter second number"

read b

let sum=$(($a+$b))

echo "Sum is $sum"


========

1) Variables  : To store the data

2) Command Line Arguments : To supply input for script file

3) Control Statements : To control execution of script file

	3.1) if - elif
	3.2) for loop
	3.3) while loop

4) functions : To divide large task into smaller tasks


===========
Variables
===========

=> Variables are used to store the data

=> Variables are key-value pairs

	a=10
	b=20
	name=ashok

=> Variables are divided into 2 types

	1) Environment Variables / System Variables

		$ echo $USER
		$ echo $SHELL

	2) User Defined Variables

		a=10
		b=20
		name=ashok


===================
Variable Rules
===================

1) We should not use special symbools like -, @, # etc in variable name

2) Variable name shouldn't start with digit

Note: It is recommended to take variable name as UPPERCASE character in scripting.


=======================
Command Line Arguments
=======================

=> The arguments which we will pass to script file at the time of execution

ex:
	$ sh script5.sh ashok it

=> We can access command line arguments in script file like below

$#  => No.of Args supplied

$0  => Script file name

$1  => First Cmd Argument

$2  => Second CMD Argument

$3  => Third cmd argument

$*  => All Cmd arguments

============
Script-6
============

echo "No.of Args Supplied : $#"

echo "First Arg : $1"

echo "Second Arg: $2"

echo "All Args : $*"

##### Execution :: $ sh script6.sh ashok it

==========
Script-7
=========

echo "First Arg : $1"

echo "Second Arg: $2"

let result=$(($1*$2))

echo "Multiply Result : $result"

##### Execution :: $ sh script7.sh 2 4

====================
Control Statements
====================

=> Script will execute from top to bottom in forward direction (this is default behaviour) 

=> If we want to control script execution flow then we have to use "Control Statements"


=======================
Conditional statements
=======================

=> Conditional statements are used to execute commands based on given condition

Syntax:

if [ condition ]
then
	stmts;
else
	stmts;
fi

=> As per above syntax if given condition satisifed then if statments will execute othewise else statements will execute.

Note: If we want to check more than one conditon then "if - elif - else - fi"


============
script - 8
============

echo "Enter your name"
read name

if [ $name == 'raju' ]; then
        echo "Hello, $name"

elif [ $name == 'rani' ]; then
        echo "Hi, $name"
else
       echo "Bye, $name"
fi

====================
Looping Statements
====================

=> Loops are used to execute statements / commands multiple times

Ex: print "hello" message for 1000 times (we can't write echo "hello" for 1000 times).


1) for loop  (Range based loop)

2) while loop (Conditional Based loop)


===================================
for loop example (1 to 10 numbers)
===================================

for((i=1; i<=10; i++))
do
        echo "$i"
done

============================
print numbers from 10 to 1
============================
for((i=10; i>=1; i--))
do
        echo "$i"
done


===========
while loop
===========

=> Print numbers from 10 to 1 using while loop

i=10

while [ $i -ge 1 ]
do
echo "$i"
let i--;
done

=> Print numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop


i=1

while [ $i -le 10 ]
do
        echo "$i"

   let i++

done


===========
Functions
===========

=> Functions are used to perform some action / task.

=> The big task can be divided into smaller tasks using functions.

=> Functions are re-usable

-------
Syntax
-------

# write the function
function functionName ( ) {
	// body 
}

# call the function
functionName


===================================================================================
Q) Write shell script to take file name as input and print content of that file
===================================================================================

---------------------------
approach-1 (read command)
---------------------------

function readFileData(){
        echo "enter file name"
        read filename
        echo "#### file reading start #####"
        cat $filename
        echo "##### file reading end #####"
}

#calling function
readFileData

----------------------
approach-2 (cmd arg)
----------------------

filename=$1

function readFileData(){
        echo "#### file reading start #####"
        cat $filename
        echo "##### file reading end #####"
}

#calling function
readFileData


===========================================================================
Q) Check presence of given file, if it is not available create that file
============================================================================

# file checking

echo "Enter file name"

read filename

if [ -f "$filename" ] ; then
  echo "File alredy exist"

else
  echo "File not available, hence creating"
  touch $filename

echo "File created...."
fi


===================================================================================
Q) Check presence of given directory, if it is not available create that directory
===================================================================================

# file checking

echo "Enter directory name"

read dirname

if [ -d "$dirname" ] ; then
  echo "Directory alredy exist"

else
  echo "Directory not available, hence creating"
  mkdir $dirname

echo "directory created...."
fi

===========================
Shell Script Assignments
===========================

Task-1 : Take a number from user and check given number is +ve or -ve
Task-2 : Take a number from user and check given number is even or odd 
Task-3  : Take a number from user and check given number is prime number or not
Task-4  : Take a number from user and print multiplication table of given number like below

5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
..
5 * 10 = 50

====================
CRON JOBS in Linux
====================

=> CRON is a utility in linux which is used to schedule jobs execution

	Ex: Run shell script (sysbackup.sh) file for every 1 hour

=> In Realtime we will have several jobs for execution on hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis

	1) Take files backup
	2) Delete temp files
	3) Monitor system resources
	4) Send alerts etc...

==========================
What is CROND in Linux?
==========================

=> CROND is a background process in Linux (Dameon Thread)

=> CROND will check for cron schedules every minute. If any job is scheduled then crond will execute that job based on given schedule.


=================
CRON JOB Syntax
=================

	* * * * * <command/script-file>

Note: Read CRON expression from left to right

=> First * will represent Minutes ( 0 - 59 )

=> Second * will represent hour ( 0 - 23 )

=> Third * will represent day of month ( 1 - 31 )

=> Fourth * will represent month of year ( 1 - 12)

=> Fift * will represent day of week ( 0 - 6 or Mon, Tues, Wed... Sun)

========================
Sample CRON Expressions
=======================

Run for every 15 mins ::    */15  * * * * <script1.sh>

Run every day @5:00 PM ::   0  17  * * * <script1.sh>

Run every month first day @9:00 AM ::  0 9 1 * *  <script1.sh>


#### Cron Expression Generator ::  https://crontab.cronhub.io/ ####


=========================
What is crontab file ?
=========================

=> crontab file is used to configure cronjobs for execution

=> In Linux machine, for every user account one crontab file will be available.

# Open crontab file

$ crontab -e

# Display cronjobs schedule

$ crontab -l

# Remove Crontab file

$ crontab -r

==================
CRON Job practice
==================

1) Launch Linux Machine with Ubuntu AMI

2) Connect with Ubuntu Machine using MobaXterm

3) Create shell script file (Ex: task.sh)

$ vi task.sh

touch /home/ubuntu/f1.txt
touch /home/ubunut/f2.txt

4) Give Execute permission for shell script file

	$ chmod +x task.sh

5) Open crontab file and configure job schedule

	$ crontab -e

6) Configure cronjob like below and close that file

	*/1 * * * * /bin/bash /home/ubuntu/task.sh

7) After one minute check present working directory 

	$ ls - l

Note: files should be created.
