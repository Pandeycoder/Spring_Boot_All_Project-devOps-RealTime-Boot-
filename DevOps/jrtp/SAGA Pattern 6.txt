=====================
SAAGA Design Pattern
=====================

=> It is a design pattern to manage complex transactions in microservices

=> In Microservices architecture multiple services will be involved

=> Every service will maintains its own data and every service is responsible to to perform specific operation

Ex:
				order_service  : will place order
				payment_service : will process payment
				order_fullfill_service : will confirm/fail order

=> First user will place order and will proceed for payment.

=> If payment is succesful then order should be confirmed else order should be failed

=> Based on payment event order_fullfill_service will take action

Note: To complete user request co-ordination is required between above services

=> As these 2 serviecs using 2 diff databases, managing tx commit and rollback is very challenging.

Note: We need to implement Distributed Transaction to handle this scenarion

### SAGA design pattern is used to manage distributed transactions in the application.

=> SAGA Transactions means sequence of transactions

=> SAGA pattern is used to simplify distributed tx management in microservices architecture

=> SAGA Pattern we can implement in 2 ways

		1) Choreography   (event based)

		2) Orchestration  (command based / controller)

=> Choreography patterns works based on events (We will use message broker to publish & subscribe events)



==============
Project Setup
==============

1) Create Maven Multi Module Project

2) Create Maven Module (Common-Bindings)

3) Create Maven Module (Order-Service)

4) Create Maven Module (Payment-Service)

5) Add required dependencies in parent pom.xml

======================================
Common-Bindings Project Development
======================================

1) Create Entity Classes

			- PurchaseOrder.java   (purchase_orders_tbl)
			- PurchaseOrderPayments.java  (purchase_orders_payments_tbl)
			- UserBalance.java (user_bal_tbl)

2) Create Repositories for entity classes

3) Create Required Request & Response Binding Classes

			- OrderRequestDto.java
			- OrderResponseDto.java
			- OrderStatusEnum.java
			- PaymentStatusEnum.java

4) Add Common-Bindings project as a dependency in order-service & payment-service




======================================
Order-Service Project Development
======================================

1) KafkaProduceConfig.java

2) KafkaConsumerConfig.java

3) RestController
			- createOrder
			- getOrders

4) Service	
			- createOrder (save in db & publish msg to order-topic)
			- getAllOrdersFromDB
			- consumePaymentsTopicMsg (check pay status & confirm/cancel order)


======================================
Payments-Service Project Development
======================================

1) KafkaProduceConfig.java

2) KafkaConsumerConfig.java

3) Service	
			- handleOrderPayment (listen to orders-topic)
					 - check order amt & user balance
					 - if user having sufficent bal then deduct bal and update payment completed

					 - produce payment status to payments-topic

============
Kafka Setup
============

1) Run Zookeeper server

2) Run Kafka Server

3) Open Kafka tool and connect to it

4) Run Order Service  (order-topic will be created)

5) Run Payment Service (payments-topic will be created)

6) Send Post req to order service and verify data
