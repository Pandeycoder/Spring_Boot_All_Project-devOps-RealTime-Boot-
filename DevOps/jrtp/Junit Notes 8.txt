===================================
Unit Testing with Junit & Mocking
===================================

=> Testing individual components of the application is called as Unit Testing

=> Unit Testing is used to identify bugs in the code

=> Unit Testing will help us in developing Quality Code (bug free code)

=> To perform Unit Testing we will use Junit with Mocking

=================
What is Junit 
=================

=> Junit is a java based framework

=> Junit is used to implement unit testing for java applications

====================
What is Mocking ?
====================

=> Unit Testing will be performed for individual components (isolated unit testing)

=> To perform Isolated Unit Testing we will use Mocking.

=> The process of creating dummy object is called as mocking.

=> Mock Objects are used only for unit testing.

Note: We can define behaviour for the mock object.

==========================
What is Code Coverage ?
==========================

=> The process of identifying which lines of code is executed in unit testing and which lines of code is not executed in unit testing is called as Code Coverage.

=> Industry standard is 80% of code coverage for the project.

=> To identify code coverage of the project we have several tools

			1) SonarQube
			2) Jacocco

=> Using code coverage report, we can identify which lines of code is missed in unit testing so that we can write effective unit test cases.

public class PalindomeCheck {

	public boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(str);
		String revStr = sb.reverse().toString();
		if (str.equals(revStr)) {
			return true;
		}
		return false;

	@ParameterizedTest
	@ValueSource(strings = { "racecar", "madam", "liril", "ashok" })
	public void testIsPalindrome(String str) {
		PalindomeCheck p = new PalindomeCheck();
		boolean actual = p.isPalindrome(str);

		if (str.equals("ashok")) {
			assertFalse(actual);
		} else {
			assertTrue(actual);
		}

	}

=========================
Rest API Unit Testing
=========================

@WebMvcTest : To represent our target class for unit testing

@MockBean : To create mock obj for given class or interface

MockMvcRequestBuilder: It is used to prepare HTTP Request

MockMvc: It provided methods to send the request

MvcResult : It is used to hold response given by REST API

==========================
@WebMvcTest(value = WelcomeRestController.class)
public class WelcomeRestControllerTest {

	@MockBean
	private WelcomeService service;

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mvc;

	@Test
	public void testGetWelcomeMsg() throws Exception {
		
		// define mock obj behaviour
		when(service.getMsg()).thenReturn("Welcome to Ashok IT..!!");
		
		// prepare http get request
		MockHttpServletRequestBuilder reqBuilder = 
				MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/welcome");
		
		// send request & hold response
		MvcResult mvcResult = mvc.perform(reqBuilder).andReturn();
		
		// validate response
		MockHttpServletResponse response = mvcResult.getResponse();
		
		//String contentAsString = response.getContentAsString();
		
		int status = response.getStatus();
		assertEquals(200, status);
		
	}
}
--------------------------------------------------
===============
Code Coverage
===============

=>To check which lines of code executed in unit testing and which lines of code not executed in unit testing.

=> Using Jacoco plugin we can generate code coverage report

=> Add below plugin in pom.xml and execute maven goals 'clean package'

<plugin>
		<groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
		<artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>0.8.11</version>
		<executions>
			<execution>
				<goals>
					<goal>prepare-agent</goal>
				</goals>
			</execution>
			<execution>
				<id>report</id>
				<phase>test</phase>
				<goals>
					<goal>report</goal>
				</goals>
			</execution>
		</executions>
</plugin>


Note: Code Coverage Report will be available in "/target/site/jacoco/index.html"


====================
Exclusion in Jacocco
====================

=> In project for few classes, unit testing is not required 

	Ex: Entities, bindings, constants & start classs


=> We can exclude those classes from jacocco report

		<configuration>
			<excludes>
				<exclude>**/in/ashokit/bindings/</exclude>
				<exclude>**/in/ashokit/Application.class</exclude>
			</excludes>
		</configuration>


==========================================
Spring Boot + REST API + Junit + Jacocco
==========================================

1) Rest Controller  : To handle request & response

2) Service : Business logic

3) DAO : data access logic

4) Junit : For Unit Testing

5) Mocking : To create Dummy Objects

6) Jacocco : For Code Coverage Report
