=================================
AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
=================================

-> S3 is a storage service in AWS cloud

-> S3 supports unlimited storage

-> Using S3 we can store any amount of data from anywhere

-> S3 supports object based storage (files)

-> We can upload & download objects (files) at any point of time using S3

-> In S3, we need to create buckets to store data

Note: Every bucket should have unique name

-> When we create a bucket end-point url will be generated to access bucket.

-> When we upload object into bucket, every object will get its own end-point url.

Note: By default, buckets and objects are private (we can them as public).

-> We can create multiple buckets in s3.

-> S3 is global service where buckets are regional specific.

=================================
Static Website Hosting using S3
=================================

-> Website nothing but collection of web pages

-> Websites are divided into 2 types

	1) Static Website
	2) Dynamic Website

-> The website which gives same response/content for all users is called as static website.

-> The website which gives response based on user is called as Dynamic website.


## Git Hub Repo : https://github.com/ashokitschool/s3_static_website_hosting.git

Step-1) Create s3 bucket with unique name

Step-2) Upload website files & folders into bucket with public read-access

Step-3) Enable Static website hosting (in bucket properties)

			index-document : index.html
			error-document : error.html

Note: After enabling static website hosting it generates end-point URL for our website

Step-4) Access our website using website endpoint url.

===================
S3 Storage Classes
===================

=> Storage classes are used to specify how frequently we want to access our objects from S3.

=> We have several storage classes in s3 like below..

1) Standard (default) : To access object more than once in a month

2) Intelligent-Tiering : Unknown access patterns

3) Standard-IA : Infrequent - Access (Once in a month)

4) One Zone-IA :  Stored in a single Availability Zone (Once in a month)

5) Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long Lived Archive data (once in quarter) (MS)

6) Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier) : Once in year (M - H)

7) Glacier Deep Archive : Less than once in year (Hours)

8) Reduced Redundency : Not Cost Effective (not recommended)

============
Versioning
============

Object Name : devops-material.pdf   (01-Sep-2023)

Object name : devops-material.pdf (10-sep-2023)  --> It will override old one

=> If we don't want to replace old objects from bucket then we can enable Versioning.

=> Versioning we will enable at bucket level and it is applicable at object level

Note: Once we enable versioning, we can't disable that but we can suspend.

=======================
What is Object Locking
=======================

-> It is used to enable the feature WORM (Write once read many times)

-> At the time of bucket creation only we can enable object lock.

-> Object Lock will be enabled at bucket level and it is applicable at object level.

=================================
What is Transfer Accelaration
=================================

-> It is used to speed up data transfer process in S3 bucket.
